# Hello, World 👋

## About Me 👨‍💻

I am an **R&D Software Engineer with a focus on Security Engineering** bridging the gap between high-performance software and secure infrastructure. With a background in **Computational Geometry** and **Edge Computing**, I specialize in building systems that are not only fast but resilient.

My professional background spans multiple complementary domains:
* **Product Security & Reliability:** Working as a Tier 3 Engineer for distributed edge platforms, mitigating critical incidents, tuning WAF policies, and automating threat detection.
* **High-Performance Engineering:** Worked on C++ engines for the CAD/CAM industry, focusing on memory safety, graph theory, and geometric algorithms.

I spend most of my time analyzing **logs, network traces, and code paths** to understand why **real systems fail in production**, and turning that into more stable and secure platforms.

## My Specialization 💡

| **Domain** | **Focus Areas** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Product Security** | WAF Engineering, Zero Trust Architecture, Threat Modeling, Incident Response (RCA). |
| **🚀 High-Performance Dev** | Modern C++ (17/20), Graph Theory, Memory Safety, Geometric Algorithms. |
| **🤖 Systems Automation** | Python SOAR Scripting, Linux Hardening, Bash, Edge Computing Logic (Lua/JS). |

## What I Work With

- **Linux & Systems:** Ubuntu, process management, file systems, containers  
- **Distributed platforms:** DNS, HTTP(S), edge computing, reverse proxies  
- **Debugging:** logs, traces, GDB, network diagnostics  
- **Security-aware engineering:** WAFs, TLS, API security, attack surface reduction  
- **Programming:** C++, Python, Bash, REST APIs  

---

## Professional & Academic Focus

- **Tier-3 Support & Reliability Engineering** Debugging real incidents in globally distributed edge platforms, dealing with DNS propagation, TLS handshakes, routing, WAF rules, and serverless traffic pipelines.

- **R&D Engineering (C++)** Worked on production-grade CAD topology analysis engines, focused on performance, stability, and correctness under real workloads.
  
- **Security & Defensive Engineering** Studying and applying:
  - API security & attack detection  
  - Log-driven threat analysis  
  - Edge-based protection models
 
- **Academic & Certifications**
  - 🎓 Preparing for **M.Sc. in Computer Science** (Focus: Post-Quantum Cryptography & Network Security).
  - 🔐 Studying for **Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)** to enhance offensive security skills.

## Featured Project — Project Orion

**Project Orion** is my personal **Linux & security lab**, where I simulate production-like environments:

- **Infrastructure:** Ubuntu Server hosting multiple containerized services.
- **Access:** Nginx reverse proxies with TLS termination and Tailscale mesh VPN for zero-trust networking.
- **Security:** Protected by commercial Edge DNS and WAF policies with custom traffic control.
- **Automation:** Python pipelines consuming threat-intelligence APIs to dynamically update firewall blocklists.

I use it to practice incident response, infrastructure hardening, observability, attack simulation and defense

## How I Think

I focus on:
- **Understanding systems end-to-end**
- **Finding the real root cause (RCA)**
- **Making platforms more reliable, secure, and debuggable**

Whether I’m inside C++ memory layouts or HTTP traffic flows, the goal is the same:  
> **Make production systems predictable and safe.**

## Let’s Connect
I’m always open to discussing **Linux Internals**, **Cybersecurity**, or **Geometric Algorithms**.

- **Languages:** 🇧🇷 Portuguese (Native) | 🇺🇸 English (Fluent) | 🇪🇸 Spanish (Fluent) | 🇯🇵 Japanese (Basic)
- **Fun Fact:** I have a background in **Astrophysics**, so I treat system logs like star charts—looking for patterns in the chaos. 🌌
